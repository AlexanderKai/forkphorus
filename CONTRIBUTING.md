# Reporting Bugs

<!-- NOTE TO EDITOR: Please keep this section similar to https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/366001364/ -->
Please make sure to include the following in your bug reports:

 - project ID (included by default if you use the bug report links)
 - error message, if any (included by default if you use the bug report links)
 - what you were doing (steps to recreate bug)
 - suspected cause, if you have an idea
 - anything else you want to include

Feel free to bump your bug by commenting on it if it seems to be going nowhere for a long time.

**If you made the project:** If possible, please try to identify which blocks are misbehaving, and create a small demo project that only contains the blocks necessary to demonstrate the bug, or at least point out which blocks in the original project are misbehaving. This isn't required but it helps a lot.

**Warning when submitting bugs for unshared projects:** It is possible to download unshared projects using the project ID (included in most bug reports). Keep this in mind when submitting bug reports for these projects.

# Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are welcome.

Please make sure to include the following:

 - **what**: what *exactly* do you want?
 - **why**: what problem does this solve?

# Pull Requests

Contributions are welcome. Builds steps are described in the README.

As long as your PR objectively improves forkphorus by doing something such as fixing a bug, it will probably be accepted.

Please try to keep the code style similar to what's already present, but this won't prevent a pull request from being merged.

## Creating test projects

Consider creating test projects to ensure that bugs don't regress. See https://github.com/forkphorus/forkphorus/tree/master/tests for details.
